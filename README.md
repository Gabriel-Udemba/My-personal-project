# My-personal-project
My name is Gabriel Ikechukwu Udemba
The title of my project is Student Exam Result Database
In this design, the student information, the Name, the exam result and subject have been stored in the database.
SO when a student key in his/her name in the search box and click submit button, all the subjects he/she has sat for will be displayed on the screen, and the student will be able to see his/her scores in each subject.
Also in a situation where wrong student name was typed in the student name box, it displays, "this student information can not be found", this simply indicate that name is not in the database.
